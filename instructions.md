This is an online assessmment. You must begin the assessmment between between {{ start }} EDT and {{ end }} EDT. You are allowed {{ duration }} minutes to complete the assessmment once you have started.

This assessmment is randomized. Every student will receive a different set of questions chosen from a larger question bank. Individual questions found to be significantly more difficult than others will be curved in your favor. This assessmment also includes other unspecified countermeasures to prevent cheating.

**Instructions**

* **DO NOT** open this assessmment in more than one browser window. If you do, your work may not be saved properly.
* You may work on the questions in **any order**.
* **You must download and turn in your answers file to Canvas before exam time is up.**
* Read questions carefully, noting any **requirements or restrictions** for your solution. There is **no penalty for wrong answers**. It is to your benefit to record an answer to each question, even if you're not sure what the correct answer is.
* Assume all code is in **standard C++11**, and use only standard C++11 in your solutions.
* Throughout the assessmment, assume all necessary `#include` headers and the `using namespace std;` directive are present unless otherwise directed.
* You do not need to verify `REQUIRES` clauses with `assert` unless specifically instructed to do so.
* In code examples, `...` is used to indicate code has been omitted for brevity. You may assume all omitted code works correctly and generally behaves as expected.

**Allowed Resources**

* You may use a compiler, IDE, or other programming tools.
